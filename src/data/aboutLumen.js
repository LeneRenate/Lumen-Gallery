    title: "LUMEN Gallery",
    body: "Founded in 2004, LUMEN is an independent exhibition-focused gallery dedicated to contemporary visual art. Established as a passion project, the gallery was created with a simple but enduring intention: to offer space for thoughtful, human-centred artistic expression.\n\nLUMEN presents a rotating programme of thematic, solo and commissioned exhibitions across photography, painting, sculpture and mixed media. Each exhibition is carefully curated to encourage reflection rather than spectacle — favouring clarity, depth and dialogue over excess.\n\nFrom its earliest days, LUMEN has aimed to remain open and approachable. While grounded in serious artistic practice, the gallery exists for a broad public: those who seek meaning in images, form and material, and those who simply wish to spend time looking.",

    title: "Why “LUMEN”?",
    body: "The name LUMEN comes from the Latin word for light. Not light as decoration or spotlight, but as illumination — the quiet act of making something visible.\n\nArt does not always provide answers, nor is it meant to. Often, it simply brings into view what we struggle to articulate: emotion, tension, memory, longing, joy. In colour, in shape, in texture and composition, we find ways of expressing what might otherwise remain unspoken.\n\nLUMEN was named with this belief in mind — that art can illuminate aspects of human experience without needing to explain them. The gallery’s name reflects a commitment to clarity rather than spectacle.",

    title: "Our Spaces",
    body: "LUMEN occupies a two-level space designed to support both exhibition and conversation. The main floor hosts rotating exhibitions, adaptable to accommodate a range of media and scales.\n\nOn the second floor, visitors will find a small café overlooking part of the exhibition space, enclosed to maintain a calm viewing environment. Studio spaces are also located on this level, used for commissioned projects, occasional hire, and artist preparation. Administrative offices supporting the gallery’s programme are situated here as well.\n\nVisitor amenities include an unattended coat check, secure luggage lockers available for a small fee, and seating throughout the exhibition areas.",

    title: "Founder",
    body: "LUMEN was founded in 2004 by Elias Verhoeven. His belief in the importance of artistic expression — not as luxury, but as a fundamental human impulse — shaped the gallery from its earliest days.\n\nDrawn to creative environments from a young age, Verhoeven recognised how art allows individuals to articulate what cannot easily be spoken. He established LUMEN as a space where this form of expression could be encountered openly and without pretence.\n\nWhile fully aware that art institutions long predate his own, Verhoeven remains deeply invested in shaping this particular space — its tone, its programme and its accessibility. For him, LUMEN continues to be both a professional commitment and a personal endeavour.",
