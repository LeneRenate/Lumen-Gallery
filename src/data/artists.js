    Bio: [
      "Elias Ward is a British photographer working primarily with black-and-white landscape imagery. Raised on the edge of a small industrial city, he grew up between disused rail lines, open fields, and expanding suburbs—spaces where natural and built environments overlap rather than compete.",
      "Ward did not begin photographing seriously until his late twenties, after studying architecture and working briefly in urban planning. His practice developed from a growing interest in how cities age, how land is reshaped by use, and how quiet moments persist within structured environments. He now works full-time as a photographer, focusing on landscapes that resist clear categorisation: neither fully natural nor entirely man-made.",
      "His photographs are characterised by restrained composition, soft tonal contrast, and an emphasis on atmosphere over narrative. Rather than documenting specific locations, Ward seeks to create images that feel familiar without being identifiable, allowing viewers to project their own sense of place and memory.",
