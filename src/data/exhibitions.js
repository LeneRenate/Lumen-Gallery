    intro:
      "Horizons brings together a curated selection of black and white photographs exploring the visual dialogue between city and nature. Spanning urban skylines, architectural details, open landscapes and intimate studies of natural forms, the exhibition focuses on contrast, structure and restraint.\n\nBy removing colour and human presence, the works invite a slower way of looking — one that foregrounds line, light and composition. From the geometry of the built environment to the quiet repetition found in nature, Horizons presents beauty not as spectacle, but as something discovered through simplicity and attention.",

    curatorial:
      "This exhibition considers how cities and natural landscapes mirror one another through form. Lines repeat, textures echo, and surfaces carry traces of time — whether shaped by human hands or natural forces. In black and white, these parallels become clearer, allowing the photographs to move beyond documentation and towards abstraction.\n\nHorizons was conceived as a pause at the beginning of the year: a visual cleanser that favours clarity over excess. The selection balances expansive views with close observation, creating a rhythm between distance and detail. Together, the works suggest that the boundary between the urban and the natural is not fixed, but continually redefined by how — and how closely — we choose to look.",

    intro:
      "York: Layers is a commissioned exhibition exploring the city as a living accumulation of time, place and practice. Bringing together historical photographs, archival material and newly commissioned works, the exhibition traces York’s development not as a series of contrasts, but as an ongoing process of change and continuity.\n\nFrom early photographic records and cartographic sketches to contemporary interpretations of the city today, the works presented reveal how traces of the past remain embedded in the present. Rather than nostalgia or comparison, York: Layers offers a way of seeing the city as something continually shaped — built upon, adapted and reimagined across generations.",

    curatorial:
      "This exhibition was developed in close collaboration with York’s city archives and invited photographers, drawing on both public collections and newly produced material. The selection spans multiple forms of visual documentation, including early photographs, architectural details, maps and recent photographic studies.\n\nBy placing archival material alongside contemporary work, York: Layers emphasises continuity over contrast. Streets shift, buildings evolve and functions change, yet patterns persist. The exhibition invites viewers to read the city as a layered structure — one where history is not fixed in the past, but remains active in the present.\n\nConceived as a flagship exhibition within LUMEN’s programme, York: Layers is intended as both a cultural celebration and an educational resource, offering multiple entry points for visitors of different ages and backgrounds.",

    intro:
      "This exhibition marks Marek Dvořák’s first major solo presentation outside Czechia. Known for his instinctive approach to street photography, Dvořák observes how people occupy shared spaces — together, apart, or momentarily unaware of one another.\n\nWorking across busy streets, markets, cafés and public gatherings, his photographs capture fleeting interactions and quiet pauses within collective environments. Whether documenting dense crowds or solitary figures watching from the margins, Dvořák’s work reflects a deep attentiveness to everyday human behaviour, rendered with warmth, humour and restraint.",

    curatorial:
      "Dvořák’s practice is grounded in proximity without intrusion. Moving through public spaces with a small, unobtrusive camera, he photographs moments as they naturally unfold — never staged, never extracted from their context. His images balance wide-frame scenes of movement and activity with more intimate portraits that focus on individuals temporarily removed from the flow around them.\n\nA dedicated portrait section brings together faces across generations, from children to older adults, offering a quieter counterpoint to the surrounding street scenes. Together, the works reveal a sensitivity to presence rather than spectacle, and to observation as a form of participation.\n\nIn Plain Sight introduces Dvořák’s work to an international audience, positioning him within a broader European tradition of humanist street photography while maintaining a distinctly contemporary gaze.",

    intro:
      "Life and Death is a short-run group exhibition bringing together three artists whose practices intersect around humanity’s most enduring and complex subject. Drawing on religious ritual, personal experience and observed moments of intimacy, the exhibition explores how life begins, how it ends, and how love, memory and community exist within those moments.\n\nAcross sculpture, painting and photography, the works reflect on themes often considered taboo, yet deeply familiar. Rather than offering answers, Life and Death creates space for reflection — acknowledging grief and joy as inseparable, and recognising ritual as a way of making meaning at the edges of existence.",

    curatorial:
      "Inspired in part by historical practices surrounding death, including Victorian-era memorial photography and religious rites of passage, this exhibition situates contemporary responses within a much older human framework. The artists do not recreate historical imagery, but instead respond to its emotional and cultural resonance through their own mediums.\n\nSculptural works reference relics, symbols and ceremonial objects, while abstract paintings translate emotional states into colour, movement and texture. The photographic works observe moments of loss and arrival — funerals, memorials, newborns and places of rest — with sensitivity and restraint.\n\nCertain works depicting death are presented within an enclosed space, accompanied by content notices, allowing visitors to engage at their own pace. Life and Death is conceived not as provocation, but as an invitation: to acknowledge vulnerability, continuity and the shared human experience that binds beginnings and endings together.",
